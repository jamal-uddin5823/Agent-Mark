# AGENT MARK
`AGENT MARK` is an SDL-based running game written in C++. The game is based on the idea that an
enemy is chasing the `Agent` named Mark and also the road he has to travel is
not so smooth. So, he must outrun the enemy as long as possible overcoming all
the obstacles along the way in order to survive. It uses basic C++ for logic building
and SDL2 Graphics Library
for the frontend.

## Objectives :

1. To apply the structured **C++** language and make a real life project.
2. Make the game attractive for the gamer with graphics and designing.
3. Addictive game with extra features( extra points, lifeline, free run ) and
increase of difficulty with time.
4. Easily customizable code and room for further development.
   
## Project Features :

1. Simple ,easily customizable code written in a modularized way with comments
wherever necessary.
2. A loading page with game name.
3. Attractive menu options to control the game.
4. Using sprite animation to make real life looking jump, slide, running possible.
5. Possibility of acquiring extra points by getting the coins.
6. Possibility of gaining extra life .
7. Increase of speed and frequency of obstacles with time.

&emsp;**Farhan Ibn Shahid , Roll - 56 (2020215666)**

* Game design ideation and implementation.
* Implementation of jump, slide animation of agent .
* Adding features of Extra coin , lifeline and implementation of free run.
* Implementation of obstacle positioning and occurrence.
* Rendering of various options and states.
* Code running and debugging.


## Platform, Library and Tools :

* **C/C++** : Implementation of the basic code in **C++**
* **SDL2** : SDL2 is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, video, keyboard, mouse , joystick and graphics hardware.
* **VS Code** : Vs code is used to write the code which is a simple but powerful IDE
* **Git/Github** : Using git to store the code online and work in a collective manner.


## Conclusions :

The goal of this project was to apply the learnings of **C/C++** language to make a simple
yet interesting game that anyone can play. We learnt to work collaboratively and also
come up with solutions to different problems. The most difficult part of the project was
to fix bugs at different stages and implement the ideas using SDL features.
